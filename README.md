# Description
Created in Week 19 of SMU's coding bootcamp. This full stack application uses React to render twelve images onto the browser. Every time the user clicks on an image, the image components shuffle themselves in a random order (React-Shuffle NPM Package). If the user clicks on a different image they will earn a point, but if they click on the same image twice they will lose the game. The objective is to get as many points as possible. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts. The game sure is a memory tester!
